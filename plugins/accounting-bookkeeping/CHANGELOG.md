# Changelog — accounting-bookkeeping

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here. Versioning is semver; bump on every user-visible change (AGENTS.md).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Advisory anti-pattern hook now fires under Claude Code.** `hooks/flag-accounting-bookkeeping-antipatterns.sh` read the target path only from `$CLAUDE_TOOL_FILE_PATH` (`$1`) — not a real Claude Code hook variable — so under Claude Code it received an empty path and silently no-op'd. Added the canonical stdin-JSON `.tool_input.file_path` fallback so the hook inspects the written file as intended. Advisory-only (no gate/behavior change beyond the hook actually running now). From the 2026-07-09 autonomous repo review (Decision 1).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-06

Scope clarification (docs-only; no agent/skill behavior change) — adds a **§0 scope-boundary** section to `CLAUDE.md` disambiguating this plugin from the `finance` plugin's controller-autopilot, ending the close/reconciliation/segregation-of-duties double-routing overlap. `accounting-bookkeeping` is now explicitly the **SMB multi-client practice-operations** lane (advisory diagnosis + readouts across a client portfolio); the **governed, audit-grade close-to-report cycle** — GAAP statement production, the enforced review→approve→lock workflow, GL↔subledger auto-match, finance-shaped ELT, and multi-entity consolidation — routes to the `finance` controller-autopilot (v0.16.0). Decoupled follow-on from the FORGE `financial-controller-autopilot` plan.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-08

Initial release.

- **`scripts/acctgops_calc.py`** — stdlib calculator: `working-capital`, `aging`, `close-cycle`. Decision-support only.
- **4 templates · 8 best-practice rules · scenarios bank · 1 advisory hook**.
