# CLAUDE.md — RavenClaude (Claude Code addendum)

@AGENTS.md

This file is Claude Code's entry point. The `@AGENTS.md` import above pulls in the cross-tool conventions (setup, layout, style, testing, PR rules). Anything below is **Claude-Code-specific** and is not meaningful to other agentic tools.

---

## Plan-mode default

For non-trivial changes touching more than two files (or any manifest), enter plan mode first and present a Keep / Update / Deny structure before writing. This matches Matt's documented preference; Cursor/Codex users won't see this guidance and don't need to.

## Memory references

User-scoped memory lives at `/home/codespace/.claude/projects/-workspaces-RavenClaude/memory/`. `MEMORY.md` is the index. Update it when something durable about the user, project, or working style changes.

## Marketplace-dev hooks

During development *on* this repo, hooks are sourced from the plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json` (auto-loaded when Claude Code discovers `plugins/ravenclaude-core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the project root). The marketplace's own `.claude/settings.json` no longer wires hooks manually — that responsibility moved to the plugin so consumers also get them.

If you need a marketplace-only hook (i.e., one that should NOT ship to consumers), add it to `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks`. None today.

## Layout enforcement (Claude Code path)

The plugin's `hooks/enforce-layout.sh` runs `PreToolUse` on `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`. It reads `.repo-layout.json` at the project root, matches the target path against `allowed_globs`, and denies off-pattern writes with a suggested correct location. The hook silently allows everything if `.repo-layout.json` is absent — so consumers who install the plugin without setting up a layout manifest are not surprised.

The matching CI workflow `.github/workflows/validate-layout.yml` is the cross-tool backstop (catches direct human commits, Cursor/Codex/Aider edits, and any case where the hook didn't fire).

Why both: Claude Code issue [#23478](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23478) confirms that path-scoped rule files (`paths:` frontmatter) load only on Read, not on Write. They cannot prevent off-pattern file *creation*. The hook (in-loop, Claude-only) plus the CI (universal backstop) is the supported enforcement pattern in 2026.

## Slash commands shipped by the plugin

After installing the plugin in any project, consumers get:

- `/init-agent-ready` — guided setup: creates `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.repo-layout.json`, and optionally a CI workflow tailored to the consumer's repo type (application / library / monorepo / docs / data / IaC).

The command is defined in `plugins/ravenclaude-core/commands/init-agent-ready.md` and writes from templates in `plugins/ravenclaude-core/templates/agent-ready-repo/`.
